        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of ketchup</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon of soy sauce</li>
            <li>green onion for garnish</li>
            <li>sea salt and pepper</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a pot of water. While the water is boiling, take out ingredients and wash the tomato.</li>
            <li>Use a knife to make a "plus sign (+)" incision in the tomato (just enough to pierce the skin) on the opposite end of the stem.</li>
            <li>When the water is boiling, place the tomato in for around 30-60 seconds.</li>
            <li>During this time, take out a bowl and fill it up with ice and water.</li>
            <li>After the time has passed, safely drain and take the tomato out and put it into the "ice bath."</li>
            <li>Heat the pot over medium heat until it is dry.</li>
            <li>During this time, take the tomato from the ice bath and begin peeling the skin off. After the skin is peeled, cut the tomato into cubes of desired size and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the dry, heated pot, drizzle olive oil and crack the eggs in.</li>
            <li>Move the eggs around and "scramble" them until they are just under cooked, then set aside. Use appropriate cookware.</li>
            <li>Use more olive oil as needed, and begin to cook the cubed tomatoes over medium heat. Cook until lightly tender (around 1-2 minutes)</li>
            <li>Add the eggs back into the pot, add the ketchup and soy sauce</li>
            <li>Let it simmer, stir occasionally</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste, give it one last stir</li>
            <li>Serve on a bed of rice and garnish with green onion</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
