        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 lb korean beef short ribs</li>
            <li>1 asain pear, peeled, cored, minced</li>
            <li>medium sweet onion (yellow onion is fine as well); chopped and minced</li>
            <li>1 piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>7 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the short ribs under cold water. Let this soak in fresh cold water for 20-30 minutes to get rid of any impurities and bone fragments. (repeat if necessary)</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the marinade: In a blender, combine Asian pear, sweet onion, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil and blend until smooth and liquid</li>
            <li>Remove short-ribs from the water and pat dry</li>
            <li>Transfer to a clean container, or marinating bag, and pour the marinade over the short ribs. Mix well to insure even coating. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in either a Korean barbecue griddle or large cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>In batches, avoid overcrowding the cook surface, cook the short ribs to desired doneness; but at least 2-3 minutes. Flip only once to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>When the kalbi is almost done, cut the short ribs between the bones so you get individual "square" pieces</li>
            <li>Plate the kalbi and top with green onion garnish</li>
            <li>Enjoy with friends!</li>
        </ol>
